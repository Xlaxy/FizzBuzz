/A FizzBuzz program is a simple program that most competent programmers
//can write and implement in less than 10 minutes.  Questions like
//these come up often in interviews, and it's amazing how many people can't
//do them.

//I wrote this program in about 5 minutes.  There are many other ways of 
//doing it, such as using if(i % 15 == 0) for the FizzBuzz test.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main ()
{
  for(int i = 1; i <= 100; i++)
  {
    if(i % 3 == 0 && i % 5 == 0)
      cout << "FizzBuzz" << endl;
    else
    if(i % 3 == 0)
      cout << "Fizz" << endl;
    else
    if(i % 5 == 0)
      cout << "Buzz" << endl;
    else cout << i << endl;
  }
  return 0;
}
